Split the Star-on-GitHub toggle, CLI Binary panel, and update-check controls into a new **Global → General** settings pane (with an inline **Updates** subsection), separate from the project-scoped Project → General pane. All three are global by nature, and grouping them under Global avoids the impression that they apply only to the active project. The standalone Global → Updates entry has been folded into this pane.

The CLI Binary panel also drops its own outlined card background and adopts the standard `padding: 0 var(--space-xl)` indent every other top-level child of `.settings-content` uses, so it sits flush with adjacent form groups instead of bleeding to the pane edges.

Wire `--version` / `-v` in the `fn` / `fusion` bin so it prints the package version and exits before falling through to the default `dashboard` command. Without this, the dashboard's CLI Binary panel reported the installed version as "unknown" because its `<bin> --version` probe was booting the full server instead of getting a version string.
