Planning sidebar now lists every saved planning session, not just active ones, so a session that finishes while the modal is closed remains selectable on refresh — previously the `/api/ai-sessions` listing filtered out `complete` rows and they vanished from the UI even though the result was still in SQLite. Adds the ability to archive and unarchive completed (or errored) planning sessions: a per-row archive button hides terminal sessions from the sidebar, and a "Show archived" toggle reveals them for unarchive. Backed by a new `ai_sessions.archived` column (migration 57), `POST /api/ai-sessions/:id/archive` and `/unarchive` endpoints (only terminal sessions are archivable so live agents can't be orphaned), and `?includeCompleted` / `?includeArchived` query flags on `GET /api/ai-sessions`. Existing consumers (`useBackgroundSessions`, `MissionManager`) are unchanged — they continue to see only active/retryable sessions.
