Fix [#21](https://github.com/Runfusion/Fusion/issues/21): the `recover-mergeable-review` maintenance sweep no longer bypasses `autoMerge` and `mergeStrategy`. The sweep now early-returns when `autoMerge !== true` (or when the engine is paused) and routes recovery merges through the engine's merge queue so `mergeStrategy: "pull-request"` is honored — eligible in-review tasks go through `processPullRequestMerge` instead of a raw local `git merge`. Operators using a PR-based review flow with `autoMerge: false` will no longer have tasks silently merged behind their back.
