# Dashboard API route registrars

`packages/dashboard/src/routes.ts` remains the single public entrypoint (`createApiRoutes(store, options)`), but route definitions are registered by domain modules in this directory.

## Shared context contract

All registrars receive `ApiRoutesContext` from `./types.ts`, built by `createApiRoutesContext()` in `./context.ts`.

Registrars should be typed as `ApiRouteRegistrar` so modules share one explicit registration contract.

The context centralizes cross-cutting dependencies so registrars preserve behavior without re-implementing plumbing.

Some registrars (for example `register-task-workflow-routes.ts`) also take a narrow dependency-injection object for non-context helpers that must stay source-of-truth in `routes.ts` (cache maps, git diff helpers, background refresh helpers, multer upload middleware). This avoids helper duplication while preserving runtime parity.

The context provides core cross-cutting plumbing:

- Request/project scoping: `getProjectIdFromRequest`, `getScopedStore`, `getProjectContext`
  - These are also exported from `context.ts` as canonical helpers for future extraction tasks.
- Engine-aware fallback behavior for project-bound and root-store APIs
- Runtime loggers and diagnostics emitters (`runtimeLogger`, `planningLogger`, `proxyLogger`, `chatLogger`)
- Proxy/auth/audit helpers (`proxyToRemoteNode`, `emitRemoteRouteDiagnostic`, `emitAuthSyncAuditLog`)
- Automation/routine resolvers and scope parsing helpers
- Shared error normalization (`rethrowAsApiError`)

## Registrar module map

- `register-settings-memory-routes.ts` — settings APIs and memory backend/file/insight routes (excluding node-to-node sync endpoints)
- `register-project-routes.ts` — `/projects` CRUD + `/projects/across-nodes`, `/projects/detect`, health/config/pause/resume routes
- `register-node-routes.ts` — `/nodes` CRUD + operational endpoints (`/health-check`, `/metrics`, `/version`, `/sync-plugins`, `/compatibility`)
- `register-settings-sync-routes.ts` — node settings/auth sync routes (`/nodes/:id/settings*`, `/nodes/:id/auth/sync`)
- `register-mesh-routes.ts` — mesh topology routes (`/mesh/state`, `/mesh/sync`)
- `register-discovery-routes.ts` — discovery routes (`/discovery/status|start|stop|nodes|connect`) with `options?.centralCore` reuse
- `register-settings-sync-inbound-routes.ts` — inbound sync/auth endpoints (`/settings/sync-receive`, `/settings/auth-receive`, `/settings/auth-export`)
- `register-settings-sync-helpers.ts` — shared sync-domain helpers (`fetchFromRemoteNode`, `readStoredAuthProvidersFromDisk`)
- `register-task-workflow-routes.ts` — task/workflow domain (`/tasks*`, `/documents`, task comments/docs/checkout/spec/attachments, PR+issue status, task file/diff endpoints)
- `register-planning-subtask-routes.ts` — planning sessions and subtask breakdown routes
- `register-chat-routes.ts` — chat session/list/mutation/stream routes
- `register-messaging-scripts.ts` — scripts API and mailbox/message routes
- `register-git-github.ts` — git/GitHub workflows and related helpers
- `register-files-terminal-workspaces.ts` — files, terminal, workspace file operations
- `register-agent-core-routes.ts` — core agent CRUD, lookups, stats/org-tree, hierarchy aliases (`/agents/:id/children|employees`)
- `register-agent-runtime-routes.ts` — agent runtime/control-plane, heartbeats/runs, access/permissions, soul/memory, revisions/budget/keys, task/inbox surfaces
- `register-agent-reflection-rating-routes.ts` — reflection/performance/context endpoints and ratings APIs
- `register-agent-import-export-generation-routes.ts` — agent import/export, companies catalog, and `/agents/generate/*` session/spec lifecycle
- `register-agent-skills-routes.ts` — skills discovery/content/execution/catalog endpoints coupled to agent capability flow
- `register-plugins-automation.ts` — plugin CRUD, automation, routines/webhooks
- `register-proxy.ts` — remote-node proxy forwarding and SSE proxy routes

## Ordering rules (critical)

Express matches in registration order. Keep registrar and in-registrar route ordering stable:

1. **Specific operation routes before generic parameterized routes** (`/runs`, `/runs/:id`, `/copy`, `/delete` before `/:id` style handlers)
2. **Specific operation routes before wildcard paths** (`/files/{*filepath}/copy|move|delete` before catch-all file write routes)
3. **Do not move proxy/script/message/file wildcards ahead of specific routes**
4. **Project/node/sync/discovery ordering constraints must stay intact**:
   - `/projects/across-nodes` and `/projects/detect` must be registered before `/projects/:id`
   - `/nodes/:id/settings` must be registered before `/nodes/:id/settings/push|pull|sync-status` and before `/nodes/:id/auth/sync`
   - `/mesh/state` must be registered before `/mesh/sync`
   - Discovery routes stay grouped after mesh routes
   - Inbound `/settings/sync-receive|auth-receive|auth-export` routes mount after discovery routes
5. **Agent ordering constraints must stay intact**:
   - `/agents/stats`, `/agents/org-tree`, `/agents/resolve/:shortname` before `/agents/:id`
   - `/agents/:id/runs/stop` before `/agents/:id/runs/:runId`
   - `/agents/:id/reflections/latest` before `/agents/:id/reflections`

If adding a new endpoint, place it in the domain registrar and verify it does not shadow existing handlers.

## Integrated routers

Integrated routers are mounted through `register-integrated-routers.ts` and intentionally called from `routes.ts` at precedence-sensitive points:

- `registerIntegratedRouters(...)` mounts:
  - `createMissionRouter` → `/api/missions`
  - `createRoadmapRouter` → `/api/roadmaps`
  - `createInsightsRouter` → `/api/insights`
- `registerIntegratedDevServerRouter(...)` mounts:
  - `createDevServerRouter` → `/api/dev-server`

Keep these calls in their current positions inside `createApiRoutes()` unless an explicit route-ordering migration is planned and regression-tested.
